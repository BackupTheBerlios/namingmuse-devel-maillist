Well, the CVS version of namingmuse does have a '--local' option, which
renames files according to the tags and policy. That's what you want if
you already have reasonably good tags for your MP3s, but bad filenames.

I'm planning at some point to implement a filename guessing module that sets
album/artist/... in the tag from the filename, but I don't know when. I
have some architectural worries to take care of first. If you want to do
this then put the module in providers/filenameguess.py and make an
AlbumInfo subclass.

There are many projects out there that do local renaming/tagging
already, but with varying degree of support for file formats other than
mp3 and charsets other than ASCII. You could search <A HREF="http://freshmeat.net">http://freshmeat.net</A>
for 'mp3 rename' and see if you find any projects that currently fit
your needs better.
